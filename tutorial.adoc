= Learning Python with Jupyter

Author: RJ Parks

== Context

We will be using Jupyter to help show people who are learning python by having it run in a web browser

== Prerequisites

* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3.7] or
* https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/[Anaconda] Distribution

Jupyter uses the Anaconda Distribution but because it is created with python it will work with a command line interface.

== Instructions

. Installation.
*Python 3.7
	
*Anaconda

. Step two.
. Step three. Use "+" and the  backtick character to add additional command.
+
```
sudo su
```
. Step four. Use the following syntax to include screenshots or other images. Note that the "+" is used to include additional content under this bullet point.

. Step five. Compile with the following command:
+
```
asciidoctor-pdf tutorial.adoc
```

== Challenge

Provide some meaningful ways for the learner to apply their knowledge in a new way.

Notice that a screenshot can be included in a separate paragraph without the "+".

== Reflection

Provide some thought questions that help the learner make sense of how the tutorial fits in the bigger picture.
