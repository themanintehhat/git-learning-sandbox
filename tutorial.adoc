= Learning Python with Jupyter

Author: RJ Parks

== Context

We will be using Jupyter to help show people who are learning python by having it run in a web browser

== Prerequisites

* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3.7] or
* https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/[Anaconda] Distribution (Recommended)
* A python file with edit permissions

Jupyter uses the Anaconda Distribution but because it is created with python it will work with the python command line interface.


== Installation

* Python 3.7 +
Run the Following Commands:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
Python 2 is supported but not recommended. Python 2 commands are as follow:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
```
* Anaconda +
Run the Installer that was downloaded. +
All defaults are fine, feel free to change the path if needed.

== Start Up
Starting Jupyter. +
In order to start Jupyter, you will need to launch it from the Terminal or Command Prompt by running the following command: 

```
jupyter notebook
```

Once launched, you will need to open a web browser and go to one of the links specified in your cmd/terminal.

here is an example of what you should see when it is launched.

== Using the Notebook. +
Once Launched, you can navigate your C:\ folder to locate a python file and open it, Or create a new Notebook +
NOTE: if you did not launch jupyter notebook from c:\ folder in your cmd/terminal you can only go up to the folder of it was launched. Nothing above it.

Editing existing files with Jupyter. +
Once opened, you can edit your source code right in the interface. You can save by using Control + S or going to the File Menu and clicking save. However to be able to run code in Jupyter, you must make a notebook. Make sure to save often!

Understanding the Notebook. +
Each notebook has cells. A cell in Jupyter can be viewed as a container. Each container can have as few as one variable or as much as the entire program. +

Each cell can be in one of two modes: +

* Cell Edit Mode 
* Notebook Edit Mode
 
Cell Edit mode is denoted by the green bar, where Notebook Edit mode is denoted by a blue bar. You are unable to edit any cell in Notebook Edit Mode. To enable cell edit mode, just click in the cell you wish to edit. A good rule of thumb is to use each container for each def statement as seen in my Rock Paper Scissors 25 program.

To run the program inside one cell, enter cell edit mode for that cell, and click run in the tool bar above. To run the entire notebook, click Cell in the toolbar and then Run All. +
Once done you can save and then go to the file menu and click close and halt. That will close the Notebook Server and the tab. To close the Jupyter server either open your cmd/terminal and use Ctrl + C twice or in the Home tab of Jupyter click quit in the left hand corner.

== Reflection
What other uses could be used besides separation of the "def" statements? +
Would being able to edit collaboratively be helpful or harmful? +
Would you use Jupyter Notebooks for a Project in the future? +
