= Learning Python with Jupyter

Author: RJ Parks

== Context

We will be using Jupyter to help show people who are learning python by having it run in a web browser

== Prerequisites

* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3.7] or
* https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/[Anaconda] Distribution (Reccomended)
* A python file with edit permissions

Jupyter uses the Anaconda Distribution but because it is created with python it will work with the python command line interface.


== Installation

* Python 3.7 +
Run the Following Commands:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
Python 2 is supported but not recommended. Python 2 commands are as follow:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
```
* Anaconda +
Run the Installer that was downloaded. +
All defaults are fine, feel free to change the path if needed.

== Instructions
. Running Jupyter
In order to start Jupyter, you will need to launch it from the Terminal or Command Prompt by running the following command: +
+
```
jupyter notebook
```
. Once launched, you will need to open a web browser and go to one of the links specified in your cmd/terminal.

. Editing with Jupyter Notebooks
Once opened, you can edit your source code right in the interface. 

== Reflection
Provide some thought questions that help the learner make sense of how the tutorial fits in the bigger picture.
