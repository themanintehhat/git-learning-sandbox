Author: RJ Parks

== Context

We will be using Jupyter to help show people who are learning python by having it run in a web browser

== Prerequisites

* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3.7] or
* https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/[Anaconda] Distribution

Jupyter uses the Anaconda Distribution but because it is created with python it will work with a command line interface.

Run the Following Commands:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
Python 2 is supported but not recommended. Python 2 commands are as follow:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
```
* Anaconda +

All defaults are fine, feel free to change the path if needed.
